  bio: `I am a certified AWS Cloud Practitioner with a strong passion for automation, web development, and building innovative tools on the internet. Over the years, I have successfully completed 60+ projects, including 12+ web projects. My work spans across developing automation tools such as a YouTube auto-engagement system (100+ auto likes, subscriptions, and 500+ auto comments) and a Medium real-time followers count tool. I have also built Express.js-based applications like an IMDb Movies and TV Shows Ratings Tracker, which fetches and displays real-time ratings and vote counts, and a BookMyShow Movie Interest and Ratings Tool, which provides live insights into audience interests and feedback. With expertise in AWS, Express.js, Node.js, Puppeteer, Cheerio, and frontend technologies, I focus on creating impactful solutions that combine automation, real-time analytics, and scalable web development.`
